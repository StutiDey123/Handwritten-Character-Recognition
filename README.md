# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Handwritten Character Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks on the MNIST Dataset
-  Hi, I have completed this project using Python with TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
-  Build a CNN to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from MNIST dataset, containing 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images.
-  Designed, trained, optimized, and evaluated a CNN model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.
-  Understood the CNN architecture, preprocess data, and visualize results to interpret model performance.
